#### Plugin Hooks
/

------------

### To-DO List
1. Remove the dependency of using Multiverse-Core and VoidGen.
2. Allow to store world in common share path or distributed storage system so as to load island dynamically across servers.
   (The create island feature has already implemented to dynamically create on across servers already. But the island world is currently stay in that server only. It is not hard to add this function but I have no time to implement it in recent months.)
3. Add support to using AdvancedSlimeWorldManager instead of normal Bukkit world.
4. Implement command permission and finalise the display messages that can be customized in messages.yml

------------

### Installation:
1. Download the latest version of NewSky from the [releases page](https://github.com/kit8379/NewSky/releases/tag/alpha).
2. Place the NewSky.jar file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server. NewSky will generate a default configuration file.
4. Configure the plugin to your needs.
